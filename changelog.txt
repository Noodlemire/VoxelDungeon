Alpha 1.0.1:
	Blobs:
		No longer are anchored to entities
		All of any one type are tied to the same instance; multiple blobs no longer repeatedly apply their effect when stacked inside of each other
		A single blob also only applies its effect once per time frame
		The applying of blob effects has been greatly streamlined and causes much less lag than before
		New blobs no longer teleport some of themselves to any locations where previous blobs existed.
		TL;DR: They actually work now.

	Fixed:
		Throwable items not being taken from the inventory in survival when thrown
		Random level algorithm of weapons and armor causing +3 and +2 equipment to become much more common than intended.
		Particles sometimes appearing far farther away from where they're intended to spawn

	Visual:
		Added some textures of grass, dirt, and cobblestone originating from Sprouted Pixel Dungeon

Alpha 1.1.0:
	New Mods:
		bucket by Kahrl, celeron55 (Perttu Ahola), and others
			-I always intended for there to be buckets, I just forgot to add this. It just so happens to be one of cannons' dependencies.

		cannons by Semmett9, eythen, and addi
			-When boss fights are implemented, they'll revolve around player preparation and the fact that they're meant to be summoned, not encountered. To help with this, I want this and maybe a couple other things like it, 

		give_initial_stuff by celeron55 (Perttu Ahola) and others
			-Players now start with a ration of food and cloth armor.

	Buffs:
		Buff HUD has been implemented.
		New buff: Rooted, locks the player or mob in place
		New buff: Bleeding, causes damage over time which comes in an initially high burst, followed by a longer period with little damage per second.
		New buff: Crippled, halves the movement speed of affected creature

	Traps:
		Traps can now be hidden. Hidden traps are invisible, but can be punched or right-clicked to be revealed. Debug info also tells you if you're currently pointing at a hidden trap.
		Added trap variants for each of the layers after the Sewers
		New trap: Gripping Trap, which applies the Bleeding and Crippled debuffs when triggered.
		New trap: Toxic Gas Trap, spawns a lot of toxic gas when stepped on.
		Duration of Poison given by Poison Dart Traps is now depth-dependent.

	Misc:
		Added a folder of the screenshots to the code
		New node: Demonite Block, craftable from 9 Demonite Ingots.
		Mystery Meat now has a chance to apply the Rooted debuff.
		Potions of Healing now remove Bleeding and Crippled.

	Fixed:
		Demonite Armor being impossible to craft
		Traps not spawning in the underground
		Poison Traps crashing the game when triggered
		Potions and Scrolls being used up in creative mode unless the creative privilege was applied
		New plants and foilage not being floodable when they logically should

	Visual:
		Added some textures of dirt and snow from Remixed Dungeon
		Added silver sand texture, based on the sand texture from Sprouted Pixel Dungeon
		Added new sign textures from Pixel Dungeon (only the Sewers one)

Alpha 1.2.0:
	Saving:
		Switched saving method from writing and reading .txt files to using minetest.get_mod_storage().
		As a result, old save files are worthless and can be deleted. 
		Also, strength and max HP upgrades gained in previous worlds will be lost.
		On the bright side, limited drops will also be reset, so you can get those upgrades back from new chests.
		Blobs now save and persist after server shutdown
		Player buffs now persist after logging off, and entity buffs now persist after despawning

	Mobkit and Mobs:
		New mod added, made by TheTermos
		Mobs_redo will be kept because of its spawn egg function.
		All the previous mobs have been replaced by replicas that were registered using mobkit instead of mobs_redo
		Note that older worlds will be filled with lots of unknown entities if loaded with this version of the game.
		Mobs from mobkit now show their name and remaining hp when in sight of a player

	New Buffs:
		Amok: Causes mobs to attack each other
		Blindness: Players have a nearly opaque black filter over their screen and mobs have their vision radius set to 2
		Haste: Grants triple movement speed
		Herbal Armor: As long as the player with this stands still, it absorbs all damage until it runs out.
		Immune to Gases: Harmful gases have no effect on you while this is active
		Levitating: Sets your gravity to 0 and makes you immune to the Rooted debuff
		Mind Vision: You can see enemy nametags through walls. Various AOE scrolls also work through walls if the reader has this buff.
		Terror: Causes mobs to flee from whoever infliced it
		Weakness: Players temporarily lose 2 points of strength

	Potion and Scroll Effect Implementations:
		Potion of Haste: When drank, grants haste for 20 seconds
		Potion of Levitation: When drank, grants levitation for 20 seconds
		Potion of Mind Vision: When drank, grants mind vision 20 seconds.
		Potion of Purification: When drank, grants immunity to gases 20 seconds. When shattered, it erases nearby gases.
		Scroll of Terror: When read, all nearby mobs become terrified of the reader for 10 seconds.
		Scroll of Rage: When read, inflicts amok upon nearby mobs. Mobs that are farther away and/or behind walls will be lured to your location.
		Scroll of Psionic Blast: When read, nearby mobs and players are severely damaged or killed, and the player takes some self damage.
			Survivors of the blast are blinded for 10 seconds and weakened for 100 seconds. Self damage is reduced if the blast hits many.

	Misc:
		Strength bonus is now 0.5 damage per excess strength, down from 1
		removed the mod give_initial_stuff, Voxel Dungeon's core mod now handles giving out initial stuff. Initial stuff itself is unchanged.
		New plant: Earthroot, grant Herbal Armor equal to the player's max hp.
		More blob optimization
		Sources of toxic gas now create triple the amount, to somewhat help account for the fact that blobs decay faster when spreading in 3 dimentions

	Fixed:
		The starting cloth armor having no description until it's upgraded
		Some cases where the whole buff hud would disappear (despite any presense of lingering buffs) until a new buff is added
		Teleportation sometimes teleporting the target into solid nodes, and many times not at all.
		Herbal Healing failing to replenish itself properly if the player tries to step onto a second sungrass while the first is active
		Potions never doing anything when shattered until the world has been reloaded at least once.
		Mobs needing to visually sink partially into the ground in order to work properly with on_move_callbacks

	Visual:
		Various buffs now say something when they're first attached.
		Potions that don't do anything when shattered now only tell nearby players about it, not everyone on the server
		There are now messages to players when they are teleported, and when a player's teleportation fails.
		Mossy Cobblestone is no longer brighter than normal cobblestone
