Alpha 1.0.1:
	Blobs:
		No longer are anchored to entities
		All of any one type are tied to the same instance; multiple blobs no longer repeatedly apply their effect when stacked inside of each other
		A single blob also only applies its effect once per time frame
		The applying of blob effects has been greatly streamlined and causes much less lag than before
		New blobs no longer teleport some of themselves to any locations where previous blobs existed.
		TL;DR: They actually work now.

	Fixed:
		Throwable items not being taken from the inventory in survival when thrown
		Random level algorithm of weapons and armor causing +3 and +2 equipment to become much more common than intended.
		Particles sometimes appearing far farther away from where they're intended to spawn

	Visual:
		Added some textures of grass, dirt, and cobblestone originating from Sprouted Pixel Dungeon

Alpha 1.1.0:
	New Mods:
		bucket by Kahrl, celeron55 (Perttu Ahola), and others
			-I always intended for there to be buckets, I just forgot to add this. It just so happens to be one of cannons' dependencies.

		cannons by Semmett9, eythen, and addi
			-When boss fights are implemented, they'll revolve around player preparation and the fact that they're meant to be summoned, not encountered. To help with this, I want this and maybe a couple other things like it, 

		give_initial_stuff by celeron55 (Perttu Ahola) and others
			-Players now start with a ration of food and cloth armor.

	Buffs:
		Buff HUD has been implemented.
		New buff: Rooted, locks the player or mob in place
		New buff: Bleeding, causes damage over time which comes in an initially high burst, followed by a longer period with little damage per second.
		New buff: Crippled, halves the movement speed of affected creature

	Traps:
		Traps can now be hidden. Hidden traps are invisible, but can be punched or right-clicked to be revealed. Debug info also tells you if you're currently pointing at a hidden trap.
		Added trap variants for each of the layers after the Sewers
		New trap: Gripping Trap, which applies the Bleeding and Crippled debuffs when triggered.
		New trap: Toxic Gas Trap, spawns a lot of toxic gas when stepped on.
		Duration of Poison given by Poison Dart Traps is now depth-dependent.

	Misc:
		Added a folder of the screenshots to the code
		New node: Demonite Block, craftable from 9 Demonite Ingots.
		Mystery Meat now has a chance to apply the Rooted debuff.
		Potions of Healing now remove Bleeding and Crippled.

	Fixed:
		Demonite Armor being impossible to craft
		Traps not spawning in the underground
		Poison Traps crashing the game when triggered
		Potions and Scrolls being used up in creative mode unless the creative privilege was applied
		New plants and foilage not being floodable when they logically should

	Visual:
		Added some textures of dirt and snow from Remixed Dungeon
		Added silver sand texture, based on the sand texture from Sprouted Pixel Dungeon
		Added new sign textures from Pixel Dungeon (only the Sewers one)
