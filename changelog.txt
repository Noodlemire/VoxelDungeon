Alpha 1.0.1:
	Blobs:
		No longer are anchored to entities
		All of any one type are tied to the same instance; multiple blobs no longer repeatedly apply their effect when stacked inside of each other
		A single blob also only applies its effect once per time frame
		The applying of blob effects has been greatly streamlined and causes much less lag than before
		New blobs no longer teleport some of themselves to any locations where previous blobs existed.
		TL;DR: They actually work now.

	Fixed:
		Throwable items not being taken from the inventory in survival when thrown
		Random level algorithm of weapons and armor causing +3 and +2 equipment to become much more common than intended.
		Particles sometimes appearing far farther away from where they're intended to spawn

	Visual:
		Added some textures of grass, dirt, and cobblestone originating from Sprouted Pixel Dungeon

Alpha 1.1.0:
	New Mods:
		bucket by Kahrl, celeron55 (Perttu Ahola), and others
			-I always intended for there to be buckets, I just forgot to add this. It just so happens to be one of cannons' dependencies.

		cannons by Semmett9, eythen, and addi
			-When boss fights are implemented, they'll revolve around player preparation and the fact that they're meant to be summoned, not encountered. To help with this, I want this and maybe a couple other things like it, 

		give_initial_stuff by celeron55 (Perttu Ahola) and others
			-Players now start with a ration of food and cloth armor.

	Buffs:
		Buff HUD has been implemented.
		New buff: Rooted, locks the player or mob in place
		New buff: Bleeding, causes damage over time which comes in an initially high burst, followed by a longer period with little damage per second.
		New buff: Crippled, halves the movement speed of affected creature

	Traps:
		Traps can now be hidden. Hidden traps are invisible, but can be punched or right-clicked to be revealed. Debug info also tells you if you're currently pointing at a hidden trap.
		Added trap variants for each of the layers after the Sewers
		New trap: Gripping Trap, which applies the Bleeding and Crippled debuffs when triggered.
		New trap: Toxic Gas Trap, spawns a lot of toxic gas when stepped on.

Alpha 1.2.0:
	Saving:
		Switched saving method from writing and reading .txt files to using minetest.get_mod_storage().
		As a result, old save files are worthless and can be deleted. 
		Also, strength and max HP upgrades gained in previous worlds will be lost.
		On the bright side, limited drops will also be reset, so you can get those upgrades back from new chests.
		Blobs now save and persist after server shutdown
		Player buffs now persist after logging off, and entity buffs now persist after despawning

	Mobkit and Mobs:
		New mod added, made by TheTermos
		Mobs_redo will be kept because of its spawn egg function.
		All the previous mobs have been replaced by replicas that were registered using mobkit instead of mobs_redo
		Note that older worlds will be filled with lots of unknown entities if loaded with this version of the game.
		Mobs from mobkit now show their name and remaining hp when in sight of a player

	New Buffs:
		Amok: Causes mobs to attack each other

	Misc:
		Strength bonus is now 0.5 damage per excess strength, down from 1

		New plant: Earthroot, grant Herbal Armor equal to the player's max hp.

		Mobs needing to visually sink partially into the ground in order to work properly with on_move_callbacks

	Visual:

		There are now messages to players when they are teleported, and when a player's teleportation fails.
		Mossy Cobblestone is no longer brighter than normal cobblestone

	New Content:
		There's now a welcome message for newly joined players
		New buff: Paralysis, prevents movement, attacking, digging, building, and item use. May be ended by physical attacks, especially at low HP
