Alpha 1.0.1:
	Blobs:
		No longer are anchored to entities
		All of any one type are tied to the same instance; multiple blobs no longer repeatedly apply their effect when stacked inside of each other
		A single blob also only applies its effect once per time frame
		The applying of blob effects has been greatly streamlined and causes much less lag than before
		New blobs no longer teleport some of themselves to any locations where previous blobs existed.
		TL;DR: They actually work now.

	Fixed:
		Throwable items not being taken from the inventory in survival when thrown
		Random level algorithm of weapons and armor causing +3 and +2 equipment to become much more common than intended.
		Particles sometimes appearing far farther away from where they're intended to spawn
		Punching often dealing no damage to rats.

	Visual:
		Added some textures of grass, dirt, and cobblestone originating from Sprouted Pixel Dungeon
		Toxic particles now spin
