#Voxel Dungeon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a recreation and adaptation of an Android rogue-like game, Pixel Dungeon by Watabou, using Minetest's engine. In particular, it is about exploring and digging into the five layers of the underground, in which access to the next layer is granted only upon summoning and defeating the boss of the current layer. Each of the sections is characterized by distinct terrain, monsters, and new ores. The boss of the final layer will grant the Amulet of Yendor; the player who picks this up will win the game.
