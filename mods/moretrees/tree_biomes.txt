Notes:
------

Beech trees are meant to replace default trees, but are themselves disabled by default.  They grow in the same areas
as the default ones do, and under the same conditions.

Fir trees appear in a snow biome only with older versions of SPlizard's Snow Biomes mod.  In more recent versions,
these trees will not grow, due to an engine bug.

Cedar trees replace, and are identical to, the original pine trees, as the minetest default game now has (a completely
different type of) pine trees.
