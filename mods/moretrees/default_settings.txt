-- Suggested configuration alternatives:

--   - Set dates_regrow_unpollinated_percent to 0
-- - Dates grow without pollination. Pollination disabled:
--   - Set dates_regrow_pollinated to false
--   - Set dates_regrow_unpollinated_percent to some larger positive value, e.g. 95
-- - Dates grow, but more and faster if male flowers are nearby
--   - Set dates_regrow_pollinated to true
--   - Set dates_regrow_unpollinated_percent to some small positive value, e.g. 33
--   - Optional but recommended: Reduce the pollination distance, e.g. to 30

-- reasons. A lot of effort has gone into ensuring that date growing will not cause lag.
