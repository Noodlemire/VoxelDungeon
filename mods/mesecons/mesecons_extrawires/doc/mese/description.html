The basic prerequesite for mesecons, can be crafted into wires and other stuff. Have a look at the <a href="http://wiki.minetest.net/Mese">Minetest Wiki</a> for more information. Mese is a conductor. It conducts in all six directions: Up/Down/Left/Right/Forward/Backward. Like horizontal wires, Mese conduction works through unloaded blocks.
